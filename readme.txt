** IMPORTANT NOTE**

This plugin uses an external service on which the plugin (geoplugin.com) relies. Please ready the terms of use and/or privacy policies here:

https://www.geoplugin.com/privacy
https://www.geoplugin.com/aup

The service is limited to 100.000 visitors per day. Also, greater than 120 API requests per minute will get you blacklisted for 1 hour, during which time you will receive a "429 Too Many Requests" response.
More than 1500 requests per minute will get you blocked permanently at the firewall meaning the server will not reply at all. If your IP is blocked by the firewall, a premium subscription is required to remove the block. In this case, you need to contact us once you've subscribed with your IP so we can manually remove the firewall block. Note, if you are blocked on the firewall, the IP will not show in the online blacklist check, but you will know because requests to geoplugin.net will time out."

If they block IP address then plugin will stop work correctly!
